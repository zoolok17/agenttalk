# agenttalk — issues & work tracker

The living record of **what we are doing and why**: work in flight, planned
fast-follows, accepted known limitations, and the backlog. Pairs with
`docs/DESIGN.md` (the why behind the architecture) and `CHANGELOG.md` (what
shipped). Keep this current — when an item ships, move it to "Recently shipped"
with its version; when a new finding lands, add it with a disposition.

**Conventions.** Status: `IN PROGRESS` · `PLANNED` · `KNOWN LIMITATION`
(shipped & accepted) · `BACKLOG` · `SHIPPED`. Severity: `P0` critical · `P1`
major · `P2` minor · `P3` nit. Each item: what, why, where, disposition.

## IN PROGRESS — v0.40.0 hardening batch (`hardening-batch-040`)

Origin: the **2026-06-28 fresh-agent audit** (6 independent reviewers; the
operator asked every agent to spawn its own fresh reviewer). The audit found a
cluster of real, *shipped* false-GO / authority defects the normal cadence had
missed — validating the assurance posture. Branch `hardening-040`; designed by
codex, gated by lead, built by dev-2, cross-reviewed by codex + reviewer-1.

- **C1 · gates.py fail-closed cluster (P1).** Four distinct fail-opens, all
  letting a release report GO when it should HOLD:
  (1) `set/waive` silently overwrite a *corrupt* `gates.json` (dropped the
  corruption HOLD); (2) unlocked read-modify-write lost-update; (3) a required
  gate under a mismatched scope was dropped (absence=pass); (4) a `severity=blocker`
  gate set `status=skipped` returned GO (reproduced). *Fix:* refuse mutation on
  `load_error`; lock the full RMW; present-but-wrong-scope blocks; `skipped`≠green
  for blockers; **+ new `tests/test_gates.py`** (the module had zero dedicated
  tests). *Why it mattered:* the subsystem meant to prevent false-GO was the
  weakest link.
- **C2 · lane shared-approval authority (P1).** `_shared_approved` accepted a
  path *prefix* match, so a broad `schema/**` approval cleared a nested
  `schema/secret.sql` whose distinct approvers were never consulted; and the
  verdict never revalidated persisted approvals. *Fix:* drop the prefix arm;
  persist the matched entry glob (not raw path); revalidate at verdict time →
  emit the previously-dead `HOLD_SHARED_WRONG_APPROVAL`; and require approval from
  **every** matching shared entry — a touched path is cleared only when each
  matching entry has a fresh approval by an authorized approver (no winner-picking
  between overlapping globs; that ordering was twice unsound). Validation rejects
  duplicate normalized shared globs. 3 reviewers converged; the fix iterated
  prefix → most-specific → all-matching as review reproduced deeper bypasses (D-11).
- **C3 · wrapper one-shot + release authority (P2/P3).** One-shot reviewer could
  starve/hang behind an unrelated unread message; the loop left a stale `.waiting`
  marker on exit; `is_release_authorized` still carried a zero-lead fallback that
  diverged from the v0.39 fail-closed envelope. *Fix:* scoped receive + bounded
  timeout; `try/finally clear_waiting`; `is_release_authorized` delegates to the
  single `loop_exit_relay_authorized` resolver.
- **C6 · end-to-end regression test (operator request).** New
  `tests/test_e2e_lifecycle.py`: in-process `cli.main` over a real throwaway git
  repo, asserting exit codes + JSON verdicts + on-disk state across the full
  lifecycle, **including negative assertions that the C1/C2/C3 bugs stay fixed**
  and that `reset` preserves the durable set. Covers the previously-untested
  CLI↔core wiring, git adapter, and reset durability boundary.

Status: final SHA `6e48e60` (all-matching-entries-must-approve + duplicate-glob
validation; 1212 tests green on 3.10+3.14). The C2 authority fix iterated through
three reproduced bypasses before review settled on all-matching (D-11); C1/C3/C6
were cleared by both reviewers. In final re-review on `6e48e60`; then lead gate
(ruff/bandit/3.10+3.14/diff-check) and ship after both approve.

## PLANNED — v0.40.1 fast-follow

- **C4 · knowledge gaps (0.38.0).** `roster --expertise` uses the latest view
  instead of the curated set (a later uncurated publish drops a verified author's
  credit) [P2]; `wp`/`request`/null-`verified_against_sha` anchors fail *open* on
  staleness instead of fail-closed [P2/P3]; publish vs curate use *different*
  append code with no fsync (crash can drop the latest) → centralize on one
  durable writer [P2]; `onboard` help/README overstate ("bounded digest grouped
  by domain/type") [P3].
- **C5 · TOCTOUs (P2).** `lane deliver` clears the lane on the sandbox direct-write
  path without reading the artifact back; `clear_restart_request` read+unlink is
  unguarded (sibling uses `_config_lock`).

## BACKLOG

- **Dead-letter / poison-message handling.** A malformed message at the head of a
  mailbox can drive backoff-restart loops; needs a dead-letter path. (Known
  limitation since 0.30.0.)
- **Model-tiering / routing.** Route work to model tiers by task class.
- **Restart resilience.** Restart-notice, checkpoint-before-compact skill,
  richer `request-launch`.
- **Auto-provision per-agent git worktree** for supervised/parallel dev (the
  harness already has a worktree-isolation concept) — removes the manual
  isolated-worktree step from the cadence.

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS (shipped & accepted)

- **Poison-message head-of-line blocking** — see dead-letter backlog item.
- **Wrapped-Codex conservative 900s stale threshold** — chosen for safety; may
  delay degraded detection for wrapped Codex.
- **No explicit visible idle signal** (minor UX).
- **`degraded.py` `window_seconds >= stuck_after` invariant** is false for
  wrapped Codex (900s) — latent, telemetry-only, no live mis-fire (P2, banked).
- **Defense-in-depth nits (P3, banked):** state helpers don't re-`validate_agent_name`
  (CLI validates upstream); `_process_alive` treats exit 259 (STILL_ACTIVE) as
  alive; `domains` normalize allows trailing dots / reserved device names (not a
  path escape); ephemeral `skill`/`profile` weak validation (not shell-exploitable;
  layered behind disabled-by-default + authorized-lead).

None were remotely exploitable or recall-worthy (they require pre-existing
corruption, specific mis-use, or are conservative/advisory).

## Recently shipped (rationale in CHANGELOG.md / docs/DESIGN.md)
